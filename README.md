# TensorFlow CNN Model for DomainNet Dataset

## Description

This GitHub repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow to process the DomainNet dataset. The DomainNet dataset comprises images from six distinct domains, including real photos, painting, clipart, quickdraw, infograph, and sketch. The images from these domains are further categorized into 345 classes. This TensorFlow-based CNN model provides an efficient way of training and testing neural networks on this multi-domain, multi-class dataset.

## Dataset Details
https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/domainnet

The DomainNet dataset consists of:

- Real Photos: 120,906 training and 52,041 testing images
- Painting: 50,416 training and 21,850 testing images
- Clipart: 33,525 training and 14,604 testing images
- Quickdraw: 120,750 training and 51,750 testing images
- Infograph: 36,023 training and 15,582 testing images
- Sketch: 48,212 training and 20,916 testing images

Each image is labelled with one of the 345 available classes. 

## Setup & Installation & Usage
- It's adviced to use in Google Colab with activated GPU
